# Instructions  

 You will be creating a program that asks the user some questions and figures out which team sport the user is thinking of.

 The first question the program should ask is how many players are on the field for each team.

 **Planning for Success**
 Start with only one sport and one if statement to see if you are printing things correctly

 Then you can move on and add these sports:

 |Sport        |Players|
 |-------------|-------|
|Volleyball|6|
|Water Polo|7|
|Baseball|9|
Soccer|11
American Football|11

For this set of sports if they answer '11' for the number of players you will need to ask another question to distingush between Soccer and American Football.


 Once you have the above sports added into your program, add these as well:

|Sport        |Players|
 |-------------|-------|
|Sepak Takraw|3|
|Curling|4|
|Dodgeball|6|
Handball|7|
Quidditch|7
|Basketball|5|
|Ice Hockey|6|
|Softball|9|
|Cricket|11|

**For Extra Credit - Learn about a few more sports and include them!**
